# Chain-of-Thought Prompting in AI Task Planner

## Overview

The AI Task Planner leverages advanced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques to ensure high-quality task decomposition and reasoning. This approach enables the AI agents to break down complex problems into logical steps, leading to more accurate and comprehensive task planning.

## What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?

Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique that encourages AI models to show their reasoning process step-by-step before providing a final answer. This approach:

- **Improves Accuracy**: By showing reasoning steps, the model produces more accurate results
- **Enhances Transparency**: Makes the AI's decision-making process visible
- **Enables Debugging**: Allows identification of reasoning errors
- **Supports Complex Reasoning**: Handles multi-step problems more effectively

## Implementation in AI Task Planner

### 1. Strategic Planner Agent

The Planner Agent uses CoT prompting for task decomposition:

```python
def _build_decomposition_prompt(self, task: Task, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a senior software architect and project planner. Your task is to decompose the following requirement into detailed, actionable subtasks using chain-of-thought reasoning.

REQUIREMENT: {task.description}

CONTEXT: {context.get('project_context', 'No additional context provided')}

Please follow this chain-of-thought process:

1. ANALYSIS: First, analyze the requirement to understand:
   - What is the core functionality being requested?
   - What are the implicit requirements not explicitly stated?
   - What technical domains are involved?
   - What are the potential challenges or risks?

2. DECOMPOSITION: Break down the requirement into logical components:
   - What are the main functional areas?
   - What are the supporting infrastructure needs?
   - What are the integration points?
   - What are the testing requirements?

3. TASK CREATION: For each component, create specific, actionable tasks:
   - Each task should be clear and measurable
   - Include estimated hours (1-40 hours per task)
   - Assign priority levels (1-5, where 5 is highest)
   - Identify dependencies between tasks

4. VALIDATION: Review the decomposition for:
   - Completeness (all aspects covered)
   - Clarity (tasks are unambiguous)
   - Feasibility (tasks are achievable)
   - Dependencies (logical task ordering)
"""

## CoT Prompting Patterns

### 1. Step-by-Step Analysis

```python
# Pattern: Sequential reasoning steps
prompt = """
Analyze this problem step by step:

1. First, identify the core issue
2. Then, break it down into components
3. Next, analyze each component
4. Finally, synthesize the solution

Problem: {problem}
"""
```

### 2. Multi-Perspective Analysis

```python
# Pattern: Multiple viewpoints
prompt = """
Analyze this from different perspectives:

From a TECHNICAL perspective:
- What are the technical challenges?
- What technologies are needed?

From a BUSINESS perspective:
- What is the business value?
- What are the risks?

From a USER perspective:
- How will users interact with this?
- What is the user experience?

Task: {task}
"""
```

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

```python
# Pattern: Test hypotheses
prompt = """
Consider different approaches and evaluate them:

Approach 1: {approach1}
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Feasibility: ...

Approach 2: {approach2}
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Feasibility: ...

Recommendation: Based on the analysis above, I recommend {approach} because...
"""
```

### 4. Constraint Satisfaction

```python
# Pattern: Work within constraints
prompt = """
Given these constraints, find the best solution:

Constraints:
- Time: {time_constraint}
- Resources: {resource_constraint}
- Technology: {tech_constraint}

Solution approach:
1. Identify what's possible within constraints
2. Find trade-offs and compromises
3. Optimize for the most important factors
4. Validate against all constraints

    return f"""
Review your previous response and improve it:

INITIAL RESPONSE: {initial_response}

Please reflect on:
1. What could be improved in the analysis?
2. Are there any missing considerations?
3. Is the reasoning sound and complete?
4. What additional insights can be provided?

Provide an improved response with better reasoning.

## CoT Response Parsing

### Structured Response Parsing

```python
def _parse_cot_response(self, response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parse chain-of-thought response into structured data."""
    
    # Extract reasoning steps
    reasoning_steps = self._extract_reasoning_steps(response)
    
    # Extract final conclusion
    conclusion = self._extract_conclusion(response)
    
    # Extract confidence level
    confidence = self._extract_confidence(response)
    
    # Extract key insights
    insights = self._extract_insights(response)
    
    return {
        "reasoning_steps": reasoning_steps,
        "conclusion": conclusion,
        "confidence": confidence,
        "insights": insights,
        "raw_response": response
    }
```

### Reasoning Step Extraction

```python
def _extract_reasoning_steps(self, response: str) -> List[str]:
    """Extract individual reasoning steps from CoT response."""
    
    steps = []
    lines = response.split('\n')
    
    for line in lines:
        # Look for numbered steps or bullet points
        if re.match(r'^\d+\.', line) or re.match(r'^[-*]', line):
            steps.append(line.strip())
        elif 'step' in line.lower() and ':' in line:
            steps.append(line.strip())
    
    return steps
```

## Quality Metrics for CoT

### 1. Reasoning Completeness

```python
def _assess_reasoning_completeness(self, response: str) -> float:
    """Assess how complete the reasoning process is."""
    
    # Check for key reasoning elements
    elements = [
        'analysis', 'decomposition', 'evaluation', 'synthesis',
        'consideration', 'assessment', 'evaluation'
    ]
    
    found_elements = sum(1 for element in elements if element in response.lower())
    completeness = found_elements / len(elements)
    
    return completeness
```

### 2. Logical Consistency

```python
def _assess_logical_consistency(self, response: str) -> float:
    """Assess logical consistency of the reasoning."""
    
    # Simple heuristic: check for contradictory statements
    contradictions = [
        ('should', 'should not'),
        ('must', 'must not'),
        ('required', 'not required'),
        ('necessary', 'unnecessary')
    ]
    
    contradiction_count = 0
    for pos, neg in contradictions:
        if pos in response.lower() and neg in response.lower():
            contradiction_count += 1
    
    consistency = 1.0 - (contradiction_count / len(contradictions))
    return max(0.0, consistency)
```

### 3. Confidence Calibration

```python
def _assess_confidence_calibration(self, response: str, actual_quality: float) -> float:
    """Assess how well the stated confidence matches actual quality."""
    
    stated_confidence = self._extract_confidence(response)
    confidence_difference = abs(stated_confidence - actual_quality)
    
    # Lower difference = better calibration
    calibration = 1.0 - confidence_difference
    return max(0.0, calibration)
```

## Best Practices for CoT Prompting

### 1. Clear Structure

- Use numbered steps or bullet points
- Provide clear section headers
- Use consistent formatting

### 2. Explicit Instructions

- Tell the model exactly what to do
- Provide examples when helpful
- Specify the output format

### 3. Context Provision

- Provide relevant background information
- Include constraints and requirements
- Share relevant examples or patterns

### 4. Validation Steps

- Ask the model to check its work
- Request self-reflection
- Encourage error checking

### 5. Iterative Refinement

- Allow for multiple passes
- Encourage improvement
- Validate intermediate steps

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Overly Complex Prompts

- **Problem**: Too many steps or instructions
- **Solution**: Break into smaller, focused prompts

### 2. Inconsistent Formatting

- **Problem**: Unclear structure in responses
- **Solution**: Use consistent templates and examples

### 3. Missing Context

- **Problem**: Insufficient background information
- **Solution**: Provide rich context and examples

### 4. No Validation

- **Problem**: No way to verify reasoning quality
- **Solution**: Include validation steps and metrics
